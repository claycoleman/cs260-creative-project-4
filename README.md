## Overview
For this lab, you will create a website that uses Vue for the front end and Node, Express, and Mongo for the back end. The front end should use an API to communicate with the back end, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting data stored on the back end. This website can be for anything you want, but should not be similar to the Vue apps we have built for activities or labs.


## Requirements
This is a creative project, so you are welcome to build what you would like. The basic requirements are:

- [ ] The site uses Vue for the front end
- [ ] The site uses Node, Express, and Mongo on the back end
- [ ] The site uses an API between the front end and back end, and supports create, read, update, and delete operations
- [ ] The site contains a footer that links to your public GitHub repository
- [x] The GitHub repository should be in your own GitHub account.

Submission
On Canvas, submit the URL for your website, which should be running on your DigitalOcean server. 
You will also be assigned 5 peer reviews in Canvas, after all the assignments are turned in. The peer reviews are to give input to your classmates but are not graded.
We will have demos in class.
Rubric for Grading
We will grade your projects based on:

- [ ] you used Vue for the front end,
- [ ] you used Node for the back end,
you have an API that includes:
- [ ] creating, 
- [ ] reading, 
- [ ] updating,
- [ ] deleting data

- [ ] how well you follow web design principles: spacing, typography, color, consistency, and responsive design.
TAs will assign scores in these ranges:

90-100: Excellent use of Vue, Node, Express, and Mongo and clearly follows web design principles
80-90: Uses Vue, Node, Express and Mongo, good effort was made, but needs work to more clearly present the data or follow web design principles
70-80: Fulfills the minimum requirement of using Vue, Node, Express, and Mongo, but does not make a strong effort to use it well or follow web design principles
